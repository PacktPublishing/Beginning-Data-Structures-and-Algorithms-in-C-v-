# Beginning Data Structures and Algorithms in C# [Video]

This is the code repository for [Beginning Data Structures and Algorithms in C# [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-data-structures-and-algorithms-c-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789610352), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course

Data structures allow us to organize data efficiently. They are critical to various problems and their suitable implementation can provide a complete solution that acts like reusable code. In this course, you will learn how to use various data structures while developing in the C# language as well as how to implement some of the most common algorithms used with such data structures.

Initially, you will get to know arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets together with real-world examples of your application. Then you will learn how to create and use stacks and queues. In the following part of the book, more complex data structures will be introduced—trees and graphs—together with some algorithms for searching the shortest path in a graph. We will also discuss how to organize code in a manageable, consistent, and extendable way. By the end of the course, you will have learned how to build components that are easy to understand, debug, and use in different applications.
